## About me
I am 30 years old. By education I am a design engineer.  
For the last four years I have been working at Russian Railways, where I learned how to cope with stress and make responsible decisions.  
What's most appealing about IT is the opportunity to bring an idea to fruition. Seeing what I imagined in my head is unrealistically cool.  
At the moment I was trained at Hexlet Programming School as a "Frontend Developer".
All my free time I devote to learning something new in the field of frontend development.  


**Soft skills:**
Ability to work in a team  
Agility of mind  
Can independently search for information and ask the right questions
